    <!-- HTML - Hypertext Markup Language -->
    <!-- created 1990 for all platforms to connect papers by scientists -->
    <!-- 1993, the first graphical browser - Mosaic emerged.  HTML and the internet had to change to work on Mosaic.  proprietary tags were created for specific browsers and certain pages viewed best on certain computers. -->
    <!-- Internet Engineering Task Force - IETF(how the networks should collaborate)
    WorldWide Web Consortium - W3C (html tag support)
    The Web Accessibility Initiative(WAI)  these grous took proactive rolls to standardize web protocols(concerned with everyone having the same ability to view the content)-->
    <!-- brower evolution 
    1990-1994 simple html, text-based content
    1993 Mosaic brought images 
    1995-1999 cross-browser compatibility falls apart
    2000-2005 browsers start separating content from style
    2005-2008 using html and css is the new standard-->
    <!-- Evolution of HTML
    1993 v1 developed by Tim Berners-Lee to link documents
    1995 v2 developed by IETF to include stylized text and tables
    1996 css1 developed
    1997 v3.2 developed by W3C to include browser specific features
    1997 v4 moved back to normalized pages across platforms 
    1998 css2
    1999 v4.01 introduced different document types
    2012 v5 back to html plus multimedia and semantic tags-->

    <!-- html5 is a cooperation between W3C and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Grout(WHATWG) - features now based on html, css, dom, javascript and reduce the need for external plugins(flash), more markup replaces scripting, device independent -->

    <!-- What happens when you type an address(a URL) into the URL bar? 
    Servers-machines hat hold shared resources, always connected, clients are for personal use like laptops, the internet consists of LANs or WANs
    The client requests a page and the server responds with the info

    URL has 3 parts, protocol, how to connect, domain, the server, document, the file requested-->
    
    <!-- Protocols 
    HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    HTTPS - Seure Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    FTP - File Transfer Protocol
    -->

    <!-- Domain Names 
    Identifies the entity you want to connect to eg. google.com
    Each has a different top-level domain determined by ICAAN-internet corporation for assigned names and numbers
    -->

    <!-- IP Addresses 
    Internet Protocol Version 6(IPV6) is the communication protocol that identifies computers on networks, each computer has a unique IP address w/ 16 different values for each of the 32 values in it,
    can represent over 300 trillion unique combinations 2 to the 128 power-->

    <!-- The Domain Name Server 
    the DNS will lookup the IP address basd on the URL you type in so no need to remember an IP address of a domain-->

    <!-- The Document 
    The default document returned is the index page-->

    <!-- The Request 
    Once the IP address is determined, the browser creates and HTTP request - has header, cookies, form data, etc.-->

    <!-- The Response 
    The server returns files, not "web pages".  It sends error codes if it can't fulfill the request-->

    <!-- Browsers 
    You need to test your site on multiple browsers
    IE on windows(), Edge(2015), Google Chrome(2008) known for security, firefox by Mozilla(), Safari()-->

    <!-- Accessiility of browsers 
    http://www.html5accessibility.com/ keeps a review of the accessibility of browsers.  Browsers should have keyboard functionality, support HTML5 tags, and support features for assistive technology-->

    <h1>Hello World</h1>
